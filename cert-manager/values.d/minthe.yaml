# This startupapicheck is a Helm post-install hook that waits for the webhook
# endpoints to become available.
# The check is implemented using a Kubernetes Job- if you are injecting mesh
# sidecar proxies into cert-manager pods, you probably want to ensure that they
# are not injected into this Job's pod. Otherwise the installation may time out
# due to the Job never being completed because the sidecar proxy does not exit.
# See https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/pull/4414 for context.
